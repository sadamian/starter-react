# Basic React Starter

A simple starter to be productive as fast as possible

## Features

A ReactJS App with

- **Style:** Nice way to apply style to Component with `Styled-Component`
- **State Management:** with `rematch` redux based solution without the verobosity
- **Testing:** With `Jest`, can test components, functions and store
- **Typescript:** To have more robust code
- **A nice dev env:** With hot reloading & TS compilation
- **Routing:** To handle routing if needed
- **Data fetching:** with `axios` should be replaced by `react-query` soon

## Main purpose of the project

It's not supposed to have great and beautiful components and 100% code coverage.

Only a personnal starter to have a good environment to start coding

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed Node.JS on your local machine

- Node.js `>= 12` - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## Installation

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
   - run `$ yarn`

## Folder structure

### Main file

##### Entry point : `index.tsx`

##### Main routing & config : `App.tsx`

- Routing and App configuration

### Components

In `component` folder organized by module

All the components and containers of the App
